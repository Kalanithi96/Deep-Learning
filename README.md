# Deep Learning Codes

As a part of Udemy's "Deep Learning A-ZTM: Hands=On Artificial Neural Networks", the codes have been written.

1. ANN:

    An Artificial Neural Network is built, trained and tested against given data. A classification problem is tackled.
  
2. RNN:

    Predicting Stock price by seeing the data as a Time-series data. It is a Regression problem.
